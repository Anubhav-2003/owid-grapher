# CaptionedChart

This Component renders a chart between a header and footer. It can also stick controls between the header and chart in interactive charts.

A CaptionedChart is like a chart sandwich:

```
[Header (bread)]
[Controls (optional jalapenos)]
[Chart (meat)]
[Footer (bread)]
```

To create a "CaptionedChart", you could also just combine a Header, ChartType, and Footer components directly.
