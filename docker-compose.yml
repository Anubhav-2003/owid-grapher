# This docker-compose file creates a full local dev environment for both grapher and wordpress. It is meant for
# OWID internal developers as the setup of wordpress requires a copy of the wordpress database that is not
# publicly available.
# A similar setup for external contributors is planned.

# This setup assumes that work on the grapher happens outside any docker container - i.e. there is no Node 16
# container included in this setup. The idea is that grapher development (as well as running webpack and the
# admin server) happens on the host, and that only the mysql, php and nginx dependencies run as containers.

# The mysql database server is exposed on the host at the default mysql port of 3306 so you can use DB admin
# utilities on the host working against localhost:3306

# Run `docker-compose up -d` to run all these services in deamon mode. The first time it will take a few minutes
# to build the containers and initialize and fill the database, afterwards it should be up in seconds.
# On the host, make sure you have a .env file with the correct settings, then start `yarn startTmuxServer` or similar
# and navigate to http://localhost:8080 to work with both the grapher admin and wordpress previews.

# Wordpress development
# The Wordpress admin is at http://localhost:8080/wp/wp-admin/
# While working on the editor blocks of the OWID Wordpress plugin, run `yarn startWordpressPlugin`.
# Alternatively, you can run `yarn buildWordpressPlugin` if you're working in Wordpress but not actively updating the editor.
# Working on the PHP code doesn't require any further tooling command to run.
