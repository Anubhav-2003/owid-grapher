Note that the `data_values` table will be incomplete â€“ it will only contain data used in charts. In production, this table is >20GB (uncompressed) and contains unreviewed and undocumented data, so we currently don't offer a full export of it.

### Inspecting the database

On macOS, we recommend using [Sequel Pro](http://www.sequelpro.com/) (it's free). [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/) is also free, works well also and is available on more operating systems.

We also have [**a rough sketch of the schema**](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1308115/64631358-d920e680-d3ee-11e9-90a7-b45d942a7259.png) as it was on November 2019 (there may be slight changes).
